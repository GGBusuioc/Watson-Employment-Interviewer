# IBM Watson Employment Interviewer

## Brief
As a final masters group project, me and my team partener Ivo Ganchev decided to develop an Employment Interviewer type of application which was labeled as a Exploratory Software as the aim of the project was to explore ideas and potential solutions for improving the interview application process for both the recruiter and the candidate. 

## How? 
By creating and embeding a chatbot into a cloud based web application using:
* IBM cloud platform for holding the web application built in Python using the Flask Framework
* IBM services such as Watson Discovery, Assistant, Tone Analyzer, Personal Insights
* IBM DevOps pipeline enabling continuous integration
* IBM NoSQL document based Cloudant database
